For use in Rhino 3D
Takes a list of strings (words and sentences) and draws them perpendicular to an input curve
Can't use spacebar (as default) in Rhino command line to create a space, so 

To make a string like this "Make instant noodles,Brew filter coffee,woodblock-print,editor-in-chief"

Input text like this: 
List of items separated by a comma. Use double hyphens (--) instead of spaces in each item, 
e.g., "Make--instant--noodles,Brew--filter--coffee,woodblock-print,editor-in-chief"

Then pick a curve and tadaa!
